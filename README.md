## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework for building web applications.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- [Solana Web3.js](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js): Solana JavaScript API for interacting with the Solana blockchain.
- [Helius SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helius-sdk): A JavaScript SDK for building applications on the Solana blockchain.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Solana Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

````bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/solana-dashboard.git

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
````

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
